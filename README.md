# Hey there! 👋🏼

I like designing and developing fun experiences.

- ❤️ Product/UX Design | Front-end Web Development | Game Design
- 🌱 Learning React, Lua, and Android Development
- 💪🏼 Working on [stroke-counter](https://github.com/jlangdesign/stroke-counter), a pet project that compares the stroke counts of Simplified vs. Traditional versions of Chinese text.
